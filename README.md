# Loan-Default-Predictor
Using both Neural Networks and XGBoost Machine Learning Models create a program that can predict whether or not a certain client will default on their loan or not. 


Using the Data Set provided I worked in Python to create a simple neural network to create a prediction for Laon Default in clients. Once I had established that the data 
was workable I implimented an XGBoost model which ended up being much more precise.
